# Microsoft Cloud Services Builder

Prototype project to experiment with putting multiple Microsoft Cloud services together "visually".

Goals:

- Make it easier to know about different services.
- Simplify visualizing services used for a given technology scenario.
- Make it easy to find Microsoft Docs, Microsoft Learn, and Azure CLI information for all selected services.

NOTE: Only a few services have Docs/Learn/CLI data associated with them. It's a prototype. :-)
