# Microsoft Cloud Services Builder

Prototype project to experiment with putting multiple Microsoft Cloud services together.

- Makes it easier to know about different services.
- Simplifies visualizing the services.
- Access Microsoft Docs, Microsoft Learn, and Azure CLI information for all services.

NOTE: Only a few services have data associated with them. It's a prototype. :-)
